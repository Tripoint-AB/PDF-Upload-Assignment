__Greetings, candidate!__


As part of our recruitment process, we have a step where you can perform a programming task. The purpose of the task is not that it should be technically challenging, but rather that it should give us insight into your problem-solving ability. What we will assess when we review your solution is:

• Design
• Structure
• Readability
• Testability
• How easy is your code to maintain

Reporting your result:
When you have completed the task, a link to GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive no later than a week before after you received the assignment. 

Tech:
To solve the task, you have to choose the techniques and languages you feel comfortable with. However, we would like you to use either (React, Angular or Vue,js). Your task is to design a client web application (you have the option to add a server application too) that helps the user to choose the right length of cross-country skis. Choose to put emphasis on the part you prefer to work with, if you prefer client side development, you put an extra focus there or vice versa.

Requirements specification:
• The application must have a user interface (simple or detailed) that is mobile friendly.
• The application must communicate between client and server (use a mock if you wont create a server application)
• The user must specify: 
  - Body length
  - Age
  - Klassik or Freestyle


Recommendations when calculating ski length:
• Children 0-4 years: body length + 0 cm.
• Children 5-8 years: body length + 10 to 20 cm.
• Classic: body length + 20cm. Classic skis are only made for lengths up to 207cm.
• Freestyle: body length +10 to 15 cm. According to the competition rules, the ski must not be less than 10 cm below the body length.

Good luck!
